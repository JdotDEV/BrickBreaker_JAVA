# Brick Breaking Game 

This is a minor project created in Java that implements a Brick Breaking Game. The game is designed with only one map, but the spawn location of the ball and paddle is randomized on every startup, making it an unpredictable and exciting game.

## How to Play

- Use the arrow keys to control the paddle and keep the ball from falling off the screen. 
- The objective of the game is to destroy all the bricks on the screen with the ball bouncing off the paddle.
- Each brick is worth a certain number of points, and the game ends when all the bricks are destroyed, or the player loses.

## Installation

- Make sure you have Java installed on your system.
- Download the "BrickBreakingGame.jar" file and save it to your desired location.
- Double-click the "BrickBreakingGame.jar" file to start the game.

## Features

- Randomized spawn locations for the ball and paddle make every game unique and unpredictable.
- Simple and easy-to-use interface for a smooth gaming experience.
- The game keeps track of the player's score.

## Future Updates

- Adding more levels with varying difficulty.
- Implementing power-ups that give the player an advantage in the game.
- Adding a leaderboard to keep track of high scores.
